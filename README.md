## Overview  
This project is a continuation of the journey to master hyperparameter tuning. It involves building, optimizing, and evaluating classification models by exploring:  
- **Manual Tuning**: Layer-by-layer analysis to identify optimal configurations based on performance and computation time.  
- **Automated Tuning**: Leveraging tools like `RandomSearchCV` and `keras_tuner` for efficient hyperparameter exploration.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/smoker-status-prediction-using-biosignals).  

## Key Features  
1. **Manual Tuning**  
   - Adjusted layers, neurons, learning rates, optimizers, activations, initializers, regularization, and dropout techniques.  
2. **Automated Tuning**  
   - Utilized `keras_tuner` for RandomSearch and BayesianOptimization to fine-tune hyperparameters such as `batch_size`, `model__activation`, and `model__neurons`.  
3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Binary cross-entropy  
   - Accuracy  
   - Customized F1 Score  
   - ROC, AUC, and Confusion Matrix
